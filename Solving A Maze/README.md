# Finding the shortest path to exit the maze by implementing algorithms: A* search, Greedy Best First Search, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search

Introduction: 
- Run the source code file and enter the name of the input file (saved in Test directory)
- After running, the program prints the results of every algorithms.

The input maze always exists a solution with one exit point.
  - Star: a starting point
  - "x": a wall and agent can't move to this place
  - "+": a reward point (not required)
The output maze:
